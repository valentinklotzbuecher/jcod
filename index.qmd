subtitle: "Resources for causal inference with panel data"

## Overview

This site collects resources on **Synthetic Control Methods (SCM)** and related approaches for causal inference with panel data, particularly when only a single (or few) treated units are available.

The methods covered include:

- **Classical SCM** — weighted combination of donor units
- **Interactive Fixed Effects (IFE)** — latent factor models
- **Matrix Completion (MC)** — low-rank imputation
- **Synthetic Difference-in-Differences** — combining SCM with DiD
